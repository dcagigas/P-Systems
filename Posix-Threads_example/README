This is an example of an implementation of a simple transactional P-System in C using Posix Threads:

  ab --> c
  ac --> b
  d --> Dissolution 
  
The first and second rules have priority one. The third rule has priority two. This last rule is executed when there are no more 'a' objects to finish the execution.
